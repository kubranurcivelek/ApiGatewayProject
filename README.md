# Node.js API Gateway Project

## Project Overview
This Node.js project serves as an API Gateway that forwards specific requests to an underlying service. The API Gateway listens on port `3000` and routes requests to two specific endpoints:
- `/api/Website/PayBill`
- `/api/Website/AddBill`

These endpoints are forwarded to a single service which handles payment and bill management operations.

## Design
### Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: The primary runtime environment for our API Gateway.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework used to handle incoming HTTP requests.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for forwarding requests to the service.

### Routing Logic
The gateway accepts POST requests to the following endpoints:
- **`/api/Website/PayBill`**: Forwards the request to the payment service to handle the bill payment.
- **`/api/Website/AddBill`**: Forwards the request to the bill management service to add a new bill.

### Assumptions
Single Service: Both /api/Website/PayBill and /api/Website/AddBill endpoints are routed to the same service running on http://localhost:3003.
Service Endpoints: The service provides the following endpoints:
**`/pay for payment operations.`**
**`/add for adding bills.`**

## Problems Encountered
1. **Service Connectivity Issues**:
   - Difficulty connecting the API Gateway to the underlying service.
   - **Solution**: Added error handling to provide meaningful error messages.

2. **Payload Parsing Problems**:
   - Trouble parsing JSON request payloads.
   - **Solution**: Included the `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON data.

3. **Docker Image Build Errors**:
   - Issues due to unnecessary files being included in the Docker build.
   - **Solution**: Added a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
